BabalWears is a full-stack fashion e-commerce web application developed as part of my Final Year Internship Defense Project. It provides a modern platform where customers can browse, search, and purchase clothing items online with features like cart, wishlist, and secure checkout, while the admin dashboard enables product, order, and user management. Built using React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, the project demonstrates practical experience in designing scalable web applications, implementing REST APIs, and deploying applications to the cloud.
